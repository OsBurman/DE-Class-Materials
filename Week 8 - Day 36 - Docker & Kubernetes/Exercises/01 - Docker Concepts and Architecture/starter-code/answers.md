## 2. Docker Architecture

<!-- TODO: For each component, write 1–2 sentences describing its role. -->

**Docker Client (CLI)**
Role: ???

**Docker Daemon (`dockerd`)**
Role: ???

**Docker Registry (e.g., DockerHub)**
Role: ???

Describe how a `docker run nginx` command flows through these three components, step by step:
1. ???
2. ???
3. ???
4. ???

## 3. Images vs Containers

<!-- TODO: Answer each question in 1–2 sentences. -->

**What is a Docker image?**
???

**What is a Docker container?**
???

**Class / Instance analogy:**
Relate a Docker image to a Java class and a Docker container to an object instance. Explain why this analogy holds.

## 4. Container Lifecycle States

<!-- TODO: Describe what each state means and how a container enters it. -->

| State    | Meaning | How container enters this state |
|----------|---------|---------------------------------|
| created  | ???     | ???                             |
| running  | ???     | ???                             |

## 5. Key Benefits of Containers

<!-- TODO: List FOUR specific, concrete benefits. Avoid vague answers.
     Example of a good answer:
     "Eliminates 'works on my machine' problems because the container bundles the app
      with its exact OS-level dependencies (JRE version, native libraries, config files)."
