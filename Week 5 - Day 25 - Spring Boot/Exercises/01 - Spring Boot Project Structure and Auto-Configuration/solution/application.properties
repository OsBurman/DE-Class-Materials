# Print the full auto-configuration CONDITIONS EVALUATION REPORT on startup.
# With debug=true, look for:
#   Positive matches: auto-configs that fired (e.g. DispatcherServletAutoConfiguration)
#   Negative matches: auto-configs that were skipped (e.g. DataSourceAutoConfiguration —
#                     skipped because no JDBC driver is on the classpath)
debug=true

# --- Reflection Answer ---
# Q: What condition caused DispatcherServletAutoConfiguration to match?
# A: @ConditionalOnClass(DispatcherServlet.class) — Spring Boot checks that
#    DispatcherServlet is present on the classpath (provided by spring-webmvc,
#    which spring-boot-starter-web pulls in). Because it is present, the condition
#    passes and the auto-configuration applies.
