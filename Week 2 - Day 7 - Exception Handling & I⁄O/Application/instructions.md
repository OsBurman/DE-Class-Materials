# Day 7 Application — Exception Handling & I/O: Student Records File Manager

## Overview

You'll build a **Student Records File Manager** — a Java app that reads student data from a CSV file, processes it, handles all errors gracefully, and writes a grade summary report to a new file. Every I/O and exception concept from today is covered.

---

## Learning Goals

- Use `try-catch-finally` blocks correctly
- Create and throw custom exceptions
- Handle checked vs unchecked exceptions
- Use `try-with-resources` for automatic stream closing
- Read files with `BufferedReader`
- Write files with `BufferedWriter`

## Part 1 — Custom Exceptions

**Task 1 — `InvalidGradeException`** (checked — extends `Exception`)  
Constructor accepts a `String message`. Used when a GPA is outside 0.0–4.0.

**Task 2 — `StudentNotFoundException`** (unchecked — extends `RuntimeException`)  
Constructor accepts a `String studentName`. Message: `"Student not found: [name]"`.

---

## Part 2 — `StudentFileManager.java`

**Task 3 — `readStudents(String filePath)`**  
Use `try-with-resources` with `BufferedReader` to read `students.csv`.  
Each line format: `id,name,gpa`  
- Parse each line, validate gpa (0.0–4.0), throw `InvalidGradeException` if invalid.
- Catch `NumberFormatException` if a field can't be parsed.
- Return a `List<String[]>` of all valid rows.

**Task 4 — `writeReport(String filePath, List<String[]> students)`**  
Use `try-with-resources` with `BufferedWriter`.  
Write a formatted header and one line per student: `"[Name] | GPA: [X] | Grade: [Y]"`.  
Use `finally` to print `"File operation complete"` regardless of success/failure.

**Task 5 — `findStudent(List<String[]> students, String name)`**  
Search the list. If not found, throw `StudentNotFoundException`.

**Task 6 — `processAll(String inputPath, String outputPath)`**  
Orchestrate: call `readStudents`, call `writeReport`, then call `findStudent` on a name that doesn't exist (to demonstrate the exception being caught at a higher level).

---

## Part 3 — `Main.java`

Call `processAll()`. Wrap in a `try-catch` that handles `InvalidGradeException`, `StudentNotFoundException`, and a general `Exception`. Add a `finally` block that prints a closing message.

---

## Stretch Goals

1. Add a method that reads a file line by line with `Files.lines()` (Java NIO).
2. Add input validation for the CSV (missing fields, empty lines).
3. Write a method that appends a new student to the CSV.
