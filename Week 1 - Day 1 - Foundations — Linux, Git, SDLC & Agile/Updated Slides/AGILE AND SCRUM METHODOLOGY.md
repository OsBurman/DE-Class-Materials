### SLIDE 1 — Section Divider: Agile & Scrum

**Large text:** Section 3
**Title:** Agile & Scrum Methodology
**Subtitle:** "How professional software teams actually work day-to-day"

⏱️ 30 seconds

💬 "Section Three. This one is critical for your day-to-day reality as a developer. Agile and Scrum. This is how your team will actually work."

### SLIDE 2 — What is Agile?

**Title:** What is Agile?
**Content:**
- Agile is a **philosophy and set of values** for software development
- Emerged in 2001 as a reaction to the failures of rigid Waterfall projects
- Core idea: **deliver working software in small increments, and adapt as you learn**
- Agile is NOT a specific process — it's a mindset
- Scrum, Kanban, XP (Extreme Programming) are all **frameworks that implement Agile values**

**The Agile promise:**
- Ship working software early and often
- Welcome changing requirements (even late in development)
- Collaborate closely with customers
- Reflect and improve continuously

**Visual:** "Waterfall → 1 release after 12 months" vs. "Agile → multiple releases over 12 months" timeline comparison

⏱️ 2 minutes

💬 "Let's start by being very clear about something: Agile is NOT a specific tool or a specific process. Agile is a philosophy. It's a set of values and principles for how software should be developed.

It emerged in 2001 when a group of seventeen software developers got together at a ski resort in Utah — yes, seriously — and wrote what's called the Agile Manifesto. They were frustrated with the way software was being built at the time — huge upfront planning, rigid requirements, teams isolated from customers, and products that took years to deliver only to find out they didn't meet user needs.

The core idea of Agile is this: deliver working software in small, frequent increments, stay closely aligned with your users, and be ready to change direction based on what you learn.

The most important thing: Agile is NOT a magic process that makes teams fast. It's a mindset. Teams that adopt Agile ceremonies but resist change, ignore customer feedback, and don't improve — they're going through the motions without getting the benefits.

Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming are all frameworks that implement Agile values. Scrum is by far the most popular."

### SLIDE 3 — The Agile Manifesto: 4 Core Values

**Title:** The Agile Manifesto — 4 Core Values
**Subtitle:** "Published in 2001 by 17 software developers"
**Content (large, clear layout — one value per row):**

| We VALUE... | Over... |
|---|---|
| **Individuals and interactions** | processes and tools |
| **Working software** | comprehensive documentation |
| **Customer collaboration** | contract negotiation |
| **Responding to change** | following a plan |

**Important note (bold on slide):** "The items on the RIGHT still have value — we just value the items on the LEFT more."

**Visual:** The Manifesto values displayed prominently with a subtle balance scale icon

⏱️ 2.5 minutes

💬 "The Agile Manifesto has four core values. These four lines are the foundation of everything in modern software development. I want you to actually understand these, not just memorize them.

Value One: Individuals and interactions over processes and tools. This means the people on your team and how they communicate matter more than what software you use or what process you follow. A great team with bad tools will outperform a bad team with great tools every time.

Value Two: Working software over comprehensive documentation. The goal is software that works — not a stack of documents describing software. In Waterfall, teams would spend months writing documentation before building anything. Agile says: build it, show it, learn from it.

Value Three: Customer collaboration over contract negotiation. Instead of defining every requirement in a contract and then building in isolation for a year, Agile teams work closely and continuously with customers throughout the project. Feedback loops are short.

Value Four: Responding to change over following a plan. Requirements change. Markets shift. Users ask for different things. Agile embraces this as normal. Changing direction is a feature, not a failure.

Now — and this is important — the manifesto itself says: 'the items on the right still have value — we just value the items on the left more.' You still need some documentation. Plans are still useful. But they shouldn't become rigid barriers to building good software."

### SLIDE 4 — The 12 Agile Principles (Condensed)

**Title:** The 12 Agile Principles — Highlights
**Subtitle:** "The manifesto has 12 guiding principles — here are the most important for you to know"
**Content (bullet list, grouped):**

**Delivery:**
- Deliver working software frequently (weeks, not months)
- Working software is the primary measure of progress

**Customer focus:**
- Satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery
- Welcome changing requirements — even late in development

**Team & People:**
- Build projects around motivated individuals; trust them
- Best architectures emerge from self-organizing teams
- Face-to-face conversation is the most effective communication

**Continuous Improvement:**
- Teams reflect regularly and adjust their behavior
- Sustainable pace — Agile promotes long-term, consistent effort
- Simplicity — maximize work NOT done

**Visual:** Clean two-column list with icons per category

⏱️ 2 minutes

💬 "The Agile Manifesto also includes twelve principles. We're not going to read all twelve, but I want to highlight the ones that will directly affect your daily work.

On delivery: deliver working software frequently — we're talking weeks, not months. And working software is THE measure of progress. Not documentation, not presentations, not designs. Does it work?

On customers: the highest priority is satisfying the customer through early and continuous delivery. And this is a big one — welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile teams see change as a competitive advantage, not a problem.

On people and teams: build projects around motivated individuals and trust them to get the job done. Self-organizing teams produce the best architectures. And face-to-face conversation — or video call — is the most effective form of communication. Not a 200-line email chain.

On improvement: teams reflect regularly on how to become more effective and then adjust their behavior accordingly. This is what the Sprint Retrospective ceremony is for — we'll cover that soon. And pursue simplicity — maximize the amount of work NOT done. Don't build features nobody asked for.

These principles should guide every decision your team makes."

### SLIDE 5 — Waterfall vs. Agile Side-by-Side

**Title:** Waterfall vs. Agile — The Real Difference
**Content:**

| | Waterfall | Agile |
|---|---|---|
| **Structure** | Sequential phases | Iterative sprints |
| **Requirements** | Fixed upfront | Evolve over time |
| **Customer Involvement** | At start & end | Continuous |
| **Testing** | After development | Throughout |
| **Releases** | Single big release | Frequent small releases |
| **Change tolerance** | Low | High |
| **Risk** | Late discovery of problems | Early feedback reduces risk |
| **Best for** | Fixed-scope projects | Evolving products |

**Visual:** Two timelines side by side — waterfall staircase vs. agile loop
**Callout:** "Most modern software companies use Agile — knowing it is non-negotiable in the industry"

⏱️ 1.5 minutes

💬 "Now that you understand Agile values, let's do a side-by-side comparison with Waterfall, because you'll encounter both in your career and you need to be able to articulate the difference.

Waterfall is sequential — phases don't overlap. Agile is iterative — you loop through mini-cycles.

Waterfall requires requirements to be fixed before you start. Agile lets requirements evolve.

In Waterfall, the customer is heavily involved at the start and at the end. In Agile, the customer is involved throughout.

Testing in Waterfall happens after all the coding is done. In Agile, testing happens throughout every sprint.

Waterfall produces one big release. Agile produces frequent small releases.

Waterfall has low tolerance for change mid-project. Agile is built for it.

And the risk profile is very different. In Waterfall, you don't discover problems until late. In Agile, you get feedback early and can course-correct before you've invested a year in the wrong direction.

Most modern software companies use Agile. Knowing it is not optional — it is an expected baseline skill."

### SLIDE 6 — What is Scrum?

**Title:** What is Scrum?
**Content:**
- Scrum is the **most popular Agile framework** in the software industry
- A lightweight framework for managing and completing complex work
- Work is organized into fixed-length cycles called **Sprints** (usually 1–2 weeks)
- Defined **roles, events (ceremonies), and artifacts** create structure
- Scrum forces regular delivery, inspection, and adaptation

**The 3 pillars of Scrum:**
- 🔍 **Transparency** — everyone can see the work and progress
- 🔎 **Inspection** — regularly review progress and the product
- 🔄 **Adaptation** — adjust based on what you learn

**Visual:** Scrum framework overview diagram — Sprint cycle with roles labeled

⏱️ 1.5 minutes

💬 "Scrum is the most popular Agile framework in the world. The majority of software teams that say they 'do Agile' are specifically doing Scrum.

Scrum takes the Agile values and gives them structure: specific roles, specific meetings called ceremonies, and specific artifacts — documents and tools — that the team uses.

Work in Scrum is organized into Sprints — fixed time-boxes, usually two weeks long, where the team commits to completing a specific set of work.

Scrum is built on three pillars. Transparency: everyone on the team can see all the work and the progress. There are no hidden agendas or secret backlogs. Inspection: the team regularly reviews the product and the process. Adaptation: based on what they learn from inspection, the team adjusts.

Those three pillars — transparency, inspection, adaptation — show up in every Scrum ceremony. Let's talk about the roles first."

---

### SLIDE 7 — Scrum Roles

**Title:** Scrum Roles — Who Does What?
**Content (3 columns):**

**Product Owner**
- Represents the business & users
- Owns and prioritizes the Product Backlog
- Defines what gets built and why
- Accepts or rejects completed work
- One person, not a committee

**Scrum Master**
- Servant-leader for the team
- Facilitates all Scrum ceremonies
- Removes blockers and obstacles
- Protects the team from outside interruptions
- Coaches the team on Scrum practices

**Development Team**
- Cross-functional group (devs, designers, QA)
- Self-organizing — they decide HOW to do the work
- Typically 3–9 people
- Collectively responsible for delivering the sprint goal
- No sub-teams or titles within the dev team

**Visual:** Three icons (person/crown, person/shield, group) with role names and key bullet per role

⏱️ 3 minutes

💬 "There are three roles in Scrum, and they're very different from traditional software project roles. Let's go through each one.

The Product Owner. This person represents the business and the users. They are responsible for the product backlog — the prioritized list of everything that needs to be built. They decide what gets built and in what order. They write user stories and define acceptance criteria. They attend Sprint Reviews and accept or reject completed work. One critical rule: there is ONE Product Owner. Not a committee. Not two people sharing the role. One person with authority and accountability.

The Scrum Master. This is a role that often confuses people. The Scrum Master is NOT a manager. They don't tell the team what to do. They are a servant-leader. Their job is to facilitate all the Scrum ceremonies, coach the team on Scrum practices, and remove impediments — blockers that are slowing the team down. If a developer is waiting on access to a system and has been waiting for three days, the Scrum Master is the one who escalates that and gets it resolved. They also protect the team from external interruptions and scope creep during sprints.

The Development Team. This is the group that actually does the building. In Scrum, the dev team is cross-functional — it might include developers, designers, QA engineers, and whoever else is needed to deliver the product. They are self-organizing, meaning they decide HOW to do the work. Management doesn't tell them which tasks to take in what order. The team figures that out. Typical size is three to nine people — small enough to be nimble, large enough to have the skills needed.

In Scrum, the team is collectively responsible. There's no 'that was Jane's bug' — the team succeeds and fails together."

---

### SLIDE 8 — Scrum Artifacts

**Title:** Scrum Artifacts — What We Track
**Content (3 columns):**

**Product Backlog**
- The master list of ALL work to be done
- Owned and prioritized by the Product Owner
- Items are called User Stories or Tasks
- Constantly refined and re-prioritized
- Never truly "done" while the product lives

**Sprint Backlog**
- The subset of Product Backlog items selected for THIS sprint
- Owned by the Development Team
- Created during Sprint Planning
- Should not change mid-sprint

**Increment**
- The working, shippable product at the end of the sprint
- Must meet the Definition of Done
- Adds to all previous increments
- Potentially releasable — even if you don't release it

**Visual:** Three boxes/columns showing how items flow from Product Backlog → Sprint Backlog → Increment

⏱️ 2 minutes

💬 "Scrum has three main artifacts — things the team creates and maintains to track work.

The Product Backlog is the master list of everything that could be built for the product. It contains user stories, features, bug fixes, technical improvements — anything. It's owned and constantly prioritized by the Product Owner. The most important items are at the top. The backlog is never empty as long as the product exists — there's always more to build.

The Sprint Backlog is the subset of Product Backlog items that the team has committed to completing during the current sprint. It's created during Sprint Planning. Once the sprint starts, the Sprint Backlog should be stable — the team should not be having new work thrown at them mid-sprint.

The Increment is the output of each sprint — the working, shippable product that gets built. It must meet the team's Definition of Done — a shared understanding of what 'done' means. Done means: coded, tested, code-reviewed, documented, deployed to the test environment, accepted by the Product Owner. The increment is potentially releasable — meaning it's in a state where you could ship it to users if you chose to.

These three artifacts create transparency. Anyone can look at the Product Backlog and understand the priority. Anyone can look at the Sprint Backlog and see what the team is working on right now."

### SLIDE 9 — The Sprint Cycle

**Title:** The Sprint — The Heartbeat of Scrum
**Content:**
- A **Sprint** is a fixed time-box (1–4 weeks, most commonly 2 weeks)
- Every sprint contains the same structure:
  1. **Sprint Planning** — decide what to build
  2. **Daily Scrum** — daily sync
  3. **Sprint Review** — demo the work
  4. **Sprint Retrospective** — improve the process
- Each sprint produces a potentially shippable product increment
- Sprints never overlap — when one ends, another begins immediately

**Visual:** CIRCULAR sprint diagram:
```
Sprint Planning → [Daily Work + Daily Standup] → Sprint Review → Sprint Retro → next Sprint Planning...
```
With 2-week timeline shown underneath

⏱️ 1.5 minutes

💬 "The Sprint is the heartbeat of Scrum. Everything repeats in this fixed cycle.

A sprint is typically two weeks. Some teams do one-week sprints for fast-moving work; some do four-week sprints for more complex products. Two weeks is the industry default.

Every sprint has the same four events: Sprint Planning at the start, Daily Standups every day throughout, Sprint Review at the end, and Sprint Retrospective also at the end.

When Sprint One ends, Sprint Two starts immediately the next day. There is no dead time between sprints. The team reviews the last sprint, then immediately begins planning the next one.

This regularity is important. Teams develop a rhythm. Stakeholders know that every two weeks there will be something new to see. Velocity becomes predictable. Planning becomes easier.

Let's go through each of the four events in detail."

### SLIDE 10 — Ceremony 1: Sprint Planning

**Title:** Ceremony 1 — Sprint Planning
**Subtitle:** "What are we building this sprint, and how?"
**Content:**

**When:** First day of the sprint
**Duration:** Up to 2 hours per week of sprint (2-week sprint = up to 4 hours)
**Attendees:** Product Owner + Scrum Master + Dev Team

**What happens:**
1. Product Owner presents the top-priority items from the Product Backlog
2. Team asks clarifying questions about each item
3. Team **estimates effort** using Story Points
4. Team selects items they can commit to completing
5. Team creates a **Sprint Goal** — a 1-sentence purpose for the sprint
6. Selected items move to the **Sprint Backlog**

**Output:** Sprint Backlog + Sprint Goal

**Visual:** Whiteboard/board with sticky notes being moved from backlog to sprint column

⏱️ 2 minutes

💬 "The first ceremony is Sprint Planning. This happens on the first day of the sprint, and it sets up everything that follows.

The whole Scrum team attends — the Product Owner, the Scrum Master, and the full development team.

For a two-week sprint, Sprint Planning typically takes up to four hours. That's not too much — you're committing to two weeks of work, so it deserves some serious thought.

Here's what happens. The Product Owner walks through the top-priority items from the Product Backlog. For each item, the dev team asks clarifying questions: 'How does this work exactly? What are the edge cases? Is there a design for this?' The team then estimates the effort for each story using Story Points — we'll cover that on the next few slides.

Based on their estimated capacity for the sprint and the size of each item, the team selects what they can commit to completing. This becomes the Sprint Backlog.

Finally, the team creates a Sprint Goal — one sentence that captures the purpose of the sprint. 'This sprint, we will deliver a working user registration and login flow.' A clear Sprint Goal helps the team make decisions when they run into problems mid-sprint.

Output: a Sprint Backlog and a Sprint Goal. The team leaves the room knowing exactly what they're building for the next two weeks."

### SLIDE 11 — Ceremony 2: Daily Standup

**Title:** Ceremony 2 — Daily Standup
**Subtitle:** "Stay aligned, surface blockers fast"
**Content:**

**When:** Every day of the sprint, same time and place
**Duration:** 15 minutes MAX (stand up to stay quick!)
**Attendees:** Development Team (Scrum Master facilitates; PO can listen)

**The 3 questions each person answers:**
1. 🟢 What did I complete yesterday?
2. 🔵 What will I work on today?
3. 🔴 Is there anything blocking me?

**Rules:**
- Start on time, every time
- Not a status report to the manager — it's a team sync
- Problems are raised, NOT solved during standup
- If a blocker needs discussion → "Take it offline" after standup

**Visual:** Three colored circles (green/blue/red) with the 3 questions; clock showing 15 min

⏱️ 2 minutes

💬 "The Daily Standup — also called the Daily Scrum — is a fifteen-minute meeting that happens every single day of the sprint, at the same time and in the same place.

Why do you stand up? Because standing up makes people want to keep it short. The moment you sit down and get comfortable, meetings run long.

Each person on the dev team answers three questions. One: what did I complete yesterday? Two: what am I working on today? Three: is there anything blocking me?

That's it. Fifteen minutes, three questions, done.

A few rules that are easy to get wrong. This is NOT a status report to the manager. The Scrum Master is not interrogating the team. This is a team sync — developers telling each other what they're doing so they can help each other and spot dependencies.

If a blocker comes up — 'I can't proceed because I'm waiting on the design for this screen' — the Daily Standup is where you surface that. But you do NOT solve it in the standup. You say 'let's discuss that after,' and then the right people stay behind and figure it out.

Start on time, every time. Nothing signals poor team discipline like a standup that constantly starts five minutes late."

### SLIDE 12 — Ceremony 3: Sprint Review

**Title:** Ceremony 3 — Sprint Review
**Subtitle:** "Show what was built — get real feedback"
**Content:**

**When:** Last day of the sprint (or second-to-last)
**Duration:** Up to 1 hour per week of sprint
**Attendees:** Entire Scrum team + stakeholders, customers, business team

**What happens:**
- Dev team **demos the working software** built this sprint
- Product Owner reviews completed items against the Definition of Done
- Stakeholders give feedback
- Product Backlog is updated based on feedback
- Discuss what to build next

**Key point:** This is NOT a formal presentation — it's a conversation
**Common mistake:** Showing slides or mockups instead of working software

**Visual:** Presentation screen icon with audience silhouettes and speech bubbles showing feedback

⏱️ 2 minutes

💬 "The Sprint Review happens at the end of the sprint. This is when the team shows what they built.

It's different from a formal presentation. It's a demo — working software being demonstrated live. The Product Owner goes through each completed item from the Sprint Backlog and checks it against the acceptance criteria. If it meets the criteria, it's accepted and becomes part of the increment. If it doesn't — it goes back to the backlog.

Stakeholders, business owners, and sometimes even real customers attend the Sprint Review. They give feedback. 'This looks great, but can we make this button more visible?' 'Actually, now that I see it working, I'd like it to do something slightly different.' That feedback directly shapes the Product Backlog for future sprints.

Here's a critical rule: you demo working software. Not slides. Not screenshots. Not prototypes. The actual, deployed application. Anything else doesn't count.

The Sprint Review is one of the most powerful moments in Agile because it creates that tight customer feedback loop that prevents teams from building in the wrong direction for months."

---

### SLIDE 13 — Ceremony 4: Sprint Retrospective

**Title:** Ceremony 4 — Sprint Retrospective
**Subtitle:** "Improve the team, not just the product"
**Content:**

**When:** After Sprint Review, before next Sprint Planning
**Duration:** Up to 45 min per week of sprint
**Attendees:** Scrum Team only (no external stakeholders)

**The 3 core questions:**
1. ✅ What went **well** this sprint? (Keep doing)
2. ❌ What **didn't go well**? (Stop doing / fix)
3. 💡 What should we **try differently** next sprint? (Experiment)

**Output:** 1–3 concrete action items to implement next sprint

**Common retro formats:**
- Start / Stop / Continue
- 4Ls: Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed for
- Mad / Sad / Glad

**Visual:** Whiteboard with three columns (went well / didn't go well / try next time) with sticky notes

⏱️ 2 minutes

💬 "The Sprint Retrospective is the last ceremony of the sprint. It happens after the Sprint Review and before the next Sprint Planning.

The Retro is for the team only — no external stakeholders. This is the team's private space to be honest about how things went.

The Scrum Master facilitates three questions: What went well this sprint — what should we keep doing? What didn't go well — what should we stop doing or fix? What should we try differently next sprint?

This might sound simple, but it's incredibly powerful. A team that runs effective retrospectives and actually implements the improvements they identify will get dramatically better over time. I've seen teams go from chaotic and struggling to smooth and high-performing over the course of six months, purely by running good retros.

The output of a Retrospective is one to three concrete action items. Not a long list that never gets done — one to three specific, actionable things to try next sprint. 'We're going to start sharing our PR for review 24 hours before the sprint ends, not in the last hour.' 'We're going to have a quick Slack thread for blockers instead of waiting for standup.' Small, specific changes compound over time.

Common retro formats: Start / Stop / Continue. Mad / Sad / Glad. The 4Ls: Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed for."

### SLIDE 14 — Backlog Refinement (Grooming)

**Title:** Backlog Refinement / Grooming
**Subtitle:** "Keep the backlog ready so Sprint Planning is smooth"
**Content:**

**When:** Mid-sprint, typically once per sprint (not an official Scrum ceremony, but a best practice)
**Duration:** 1 hour (no more than 10% of sprint capacity)
**Attendees:** Product Owner + Dev Team (+ Scrum Master)

**What happens:**
- Review upcoming backlog items
- Break large stories into smaller, workable pieces
- Add detail, acceptance criteria, and clarifications
- Re-estimate or estimate unpointed stories
- Re-prioritize based on new information

**Why it matters:** If you skip refinement, Sprint Planning becomes chaotic and items aren't ready to work on

**Visual:** Funnel diagram — large rough ideas at top → refined, estimated, ready stories at bottom

⏱️ 1.5 minutes

💬 "Backlog Refinement — also called Grooming — is not an official Scrum ceremony, but virtually every Scrum team does it, and you need to know what it is.

Mid-sprint, usually around the midpoint, the Product Owner and the dev team get together for about an hour to review upcoming backlog items. The goal is to make sure the stories that are coming up next sprint are ready to go.

'Ready' means: the acceptance criteria are written and clear. The story has been estimated. Any questions have been answered. Any dependencies have been identified. Large stories have been broken into smaller, workable pieces.

Why does this matter? Because if you go into Sprint Planning without refined stories, Planning becomes a three-hour disaster where everyone is confused about what the stories mean, the estimates are all over the place, and you walk out without a real commitment.

Refinement is insurance for Sprint Planning. It keeps the team moving smoothly and prevents the Product Owner from showing up to Sprint Planning with a pile of vague, half-written stories."

---

### SLIDE 15 — User Stories

**Title:** User Stories — How We Define Work
**Subtitle:** "Work items written from the user's perspective"
**Content:**

**Format:**
> **As a** [type of user],
> **I want** [an action or feature],
> **So that** [a benefit or goal].

**Examples:**
- "As a **customer**, I want to **add items to my cart**, so that I can **purchase multiple things at once**."
- "As an **admin**, I want to **see all user accounts**, so that I can **manage access permissions**."

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Written alongside each story — defines when the story is "done"
- Example: "Cart displays correct item count" / "Total price updates automatically"

**INVEST Criteria for good stories:**
- **I**ndependent · **N**egotiable · **V**aluable · **E**stimable · **S**mall · **T**estable

**Visual:** Story card template with the format and an example filled in

⏱️ 2 minutes

💬 "Let's talk about User Stories — because these are the core unit of work in Scrum.

A user story is a short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the person who needs it. There's a specific format that's widely used:

'As a [type of user], I want [an action or feature], so that [a benefit or goal].'

Let's look at the examples. 'As a customer, I want to add items to my cart, so that I can purchase multiple things at once.' Simple, clear, user-focused. 'As an admin, I want to see all user accounts, so that I can manage access permissions.'

Notice what this format forces: you have to identify WHO needs it, WHAT they need, and WHY. That 'so that' clause is critical — if you can't articulate why a feature matters, maybe it shouldn't be built.

Every user story also needs Acceptance Criteria — a list of specific conditions that must be true for the story to be considered done. 'Cart displays the correct item count. Total price updates when quantity changes. User receives a confirmation message.'

There's a great acronym for evaluating stories called INVEST: Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable. A good story should satisfy all six."

### SLIDE 16 — Story Pointing & Estimation

**Title:** Story Points — Estimating Effort
**Subtitle:** "How teams measure the size and complexity of work"
**Content:**

**What are story points?**
- A relative unit of measure for effort, complexity, and uncertainty
- NOT hours — "1 point" doesn't mean "1 hour"
- Used to forecast how much work fits in a sprint

**Fibonacci Scale (most common):** 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21
- 1 = trivially simple (fix a typo)
- 3 = small, well-understood task
- 5 = medium complexity
- 8 = complex, some unknowns
- 13 = very large — should probably be split
- 21 = epic — must be broken down

**Planning Poker:**
- Each team member secretly picks a card
- All reveal at once
- Discuss differences, re-estimate → consensus

**Team Velocity:** Average story points completed per sprint — used to plan future sprints

**Visual:** Playing card icons with Fibonacci numbers; gauge showing velocity over time

⏱️ 2.5 minutes

💬 "How do teams estimate how much work they can fit in a sprint? With Story Points.

Here's the key thing to understand about story points: they are NOT hours. I want to say that again because this confuses everyone at first. Story points are NOT hours or days of work. They are a relative unit of measure that captures effort, complexity, and uncertainty — all three factors combined.

Teams use the Fibonacci sequence for story points: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21. Why Fibonacci? Because the gap between numbers grows as the numbers get bigger, which mirrors how estimation uncertainty grows for larger tasks.

A 1-point story is trivial — fixing a typo or changing a label. A 3-point story is small and well-understood. A 5-point story is moderate complexity. An 8-point story is complex with some unknowns. A 13-point story is very large — it should probably be split into smaller stories. A 21-point story is an epic — it must be broken down before it can be worked on.

The magic of story points is that they become relative to your team. What's a 5 for your team is what matters — not what a 5 means for another team. Over time, your team knows: 'We typically complete about 40 points per sprint.' That's your velocity.

The most common estimation technique is Planning Poker. Each team member secretly picks a card representing their estimate, and then everyone reveals at the same time. If there's a big disagreement — someone says 3 and someone says 13 — you discuss why, and come to a consensus. Hiding the estimates until everyone reveals prevents anchoring — where everyone just agrees with the first number they hear."

### SLIDE 17 — Velocity & Burndown Charts

**Title:** Tracking Progress: Velocity & Burndown
**Content (two halves):**

**Velocity**
- Total story points completed per sprint
- Average velocity used to predict future sprint capacity
- Example: Team averages 40 points/sprint → don't commit to 60 points
- Velocity improves as team matures

**Burndown Chart**
- X-axis: days in sprint
- Y-axis: story points remaining
- Ideal line: straight diagonal from total points → 0
- Actual line: shows real progress
- If actual line is above ideal → behind schedule
- If below → ahead of schedule

**Visual:**
- Bar chart showing velocity over 5+ sprints
- Burndown chart showing ideal vs. actual lines

⏱️ 2 minutes

💬 "Two important tracking tools: velocity and burndown charts.

Velocity is simply the number of story points your team completes in a sprint. If you completed 38 points last sprint, your velocity for that sprint was 38. Over time, your average velocity stabilizes — it might be around 40 points per sprint. This is incredibly useful for planning. If your product backlog has 200 points of work remaining, and your velocity is 40 points per sprint, you can forecast roughly five more sprints — about ten weeks — to complete it. That's powerful information for the business.

A Burndown Chart visualizes progress within a single sprint. The Y-axis shows story points remaining. The X-axis shows the days of the sprint. The ideal line is a straight diagonal from the total commitment at day one down to zero at the last day. The actual line tracks real progress.

If the actual line is above the ideal line — the team is behind. If it's below — they're ahead. Mid-sprint, the Scrum Master uses the burndown chart to see if the team is on track to complete everything they committed to, and if not, to have the conversation with the Product Owner about what to cut.

### SLIDE 18 — Jira & Project Boards

**Title:** Jira & Project Management Tools
**Subtitle:** "Where the team tracks all their work digitally"
**Content:**

**What is Jira?**
- The most widely-used project management tool for Agile teams
- Developed by Atlassian
- Used to manage backlogs, sprints, issues, bugs, and reporting
- Industry standard — you will almost certainly use it on the job

**Key Jira concepts:**
- **Epic** — large body of work (e.g., "User Authentication System")
- **Story** — a user-facing feature (e.g., "User can log in with email")
- **Task** — a technical task (e.g., "Set up JWT middleware")
- **Bug** — a defect to fix
- **Subtask** — breakdown of a story or task

**The Jira Board (Kanban/Sprint Board):**
```
| TO DO | IN PROGRESS | IN REVIEW | DONE |
|-------|-------------|-----------|------|
| Story | Story       | Story     | Story|
```
Cards move left to right as work progresses

💬 "Jira. You are going to use Jira. Most of you will use it within your first week at a job.

Jira is a project management tool made by Atlassian. It's the industry standard for Agile development teams. Everything we've talked about — the product backlog, the sprint backlog, user stories, bugs, tasks — all of it lives in Jira.

Let me walk you through the key concepts. An Epic is a large body of work — something like 'Build the User Authentication System.' An Epic might take three or four sprints. Stories are the user-facing features within that epic. Tasks are technical work items that aren't directly user-facing — setting up a database, writing a configuration file. Bugs are defects that need to be fixed. Subtasks break down a story or task further.

The Jira Sprint Board is what your team looks at every day. It's a Kanban-style board with columns: To Do, In Progress, In Review, Done. Every story card sits in one of those columns. When you start working on a story, you move it to In Progress. When you submit a pull request for review, you move it to In Review. When it's accepted and merged, Done.

At a glance, anyone on the team can see what's being worked on, what's blocked, and what's done. That's transparency in action. Jira also tracks your velocity, generates burndown charts, and helps the Product Owner manage the backlog. Take some time outside of class to explore Jira — Atlassian has a free tier."

### SLIDE 19 — Kanban Boards

**Title:** Kanban Boards — Visualizing Workflow
**Subtitle:** "Another Agile tool for managing continuous flow work"
**Content:**

**Kanban vs. Scrum:**
- Kanban has no sprints — work flows continuously
- Focus is on **limiting work-in-progress (WIP)**
- Great for support/ops teams or teams with unpredictable work

**The Kanban board:**
- Columns represent workflow stages
- Cards represent work items
- **WIP Limits** cap how many items can be in each column
- Goal: items flow as quickly as possible from left to right

**Example columns:** Backlog → To Do → In Progress → Code Review → Testing → Done

**Both Jira and GitHub Projects can be used as Kanban boards**

**Visual:** Kanban board with WIP limits shown above each column in red/green circles

💬 "One more tool worth knowing: Kanban boards.

Kanban is actually a separate Agile framework from Scrum, but it's worth understanding because you'll see it used — sometimes alongside Scrum, sometimes instead of it.

The key differences: Kanban has no sprints. Work flows continuously. And Kanban uses WIP limits — Work In Progress limits — to cap how many items can be in each column at once. If 'In Progress' has a WIP limit of 3, no one can start a new item until someone finishes one.

This keeps the team focused and prevents the common trap of having ten things all half-done at the same time.

Kanban is especially popular for support and operations teams who have unpredictable, incoming work that doesn't fit neatly into two-week sprint cycles. Both Jira and GitHub Projects can be configured as Kanban boards."

### SLIDE 20 — How It All Connects

**Title:** How SDLC, Fullstack & Agile Work Together
**Content:**
```
SDLC gives us the PHASES:     Planning → Design → Build → Test → Deploy → Maintain

Agile/Scrum gives us the HOW: Iterate through those phases in 2-week sprints

Fullstack gives us the WHAT:  Frontend + Backend + Database + APIs to build

Jira/Boards track it ALL:     Stories → Sprint Backlog → In Progress → Done
```
**Visual:** A diagram connecting all three concepts with arrows showing how they feed into each other
**Callout box:** "At your first job, you will use ALL of these things — often on day one."

⏱️ 1.5 minutes

💬 "Before we wrap up, I want to zoom out and show you how all three things we covered today work together, because in the real world, they're inseparable.

The SDLC gives you the phases — Planning, Requirements, Design, Build, Test, Deploy, Maintain. These phases always happen, in some form, for every software project.

Agile and Scrum give you the HOW — instead of doing all those phases once in a big sequential waterfall, you iterate through them in two-week sprints. Each sprint has its own mini-planning, design, build, and test cycle.

Fullstack knowledge tells you WHAT you're building in those sprints — frontend, backend, database, APIs.

And Jira and your project board track all of it — from the first story in the backlog to the last item being marked done.

On your first day at a job, your team will be in the middle of a sprint. You'll join a Daily Standup. You'll be assigned a Jira ticket. That ticket is a user story with acceptance criteria. You'll build a feature that touches the frontend, the backend, or both. It'll go through code review and testing. And two weeks later, you'll demo it in a Sprint Review. Everything we covered today is going to happen on day one."

### SLIDE 21 — Key Takeaways

**Title:** Key Takeaways — Remember These
**Content:**

**SDLC:**
- ✅ 7 phases: Planning, Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance
- ✅ Every phase has deliverables — skipping phases causes problems

**Fullstack:**
- ✅ Three layers: Frontend (React/JS), Backend (Node/Python), Database (SQL/NoSQL)
- ✅ APIs connect layers; DevOps ships the code

**Agile & Scrum:**
- ✅ Agile = values & mindset (Agile Manifesto)
- ✅ Scrum = framework with Roles, Ceremonies, Artifacts
- ✅ 4 ceremonies: Sprint Planning, Daily Standup, Sprint Review, Sprint Retro
- ✅ Story Points estimate effort (not time)
- ✅ Jira tracks everything on a visual board

**Visual:** Three icons (cycle, stack, sprint board) with short bullets beside each

💬 "Let me leave you with the most important things to take away today.

For SDLC: there are seven phases — Planning, Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance. Every phase has deliverables. Skipping phases creates problems.

For Fullstack: three layers — Frontend, Backend, Database. APIs connect them. DevOps ships the code. Understand the whole picture even if you specialize.

For Agile and Scrum: Agile is a mindset based on the Manifesto's four values. Scrum is the framework that puts it into practice. Four ceremonies: Sprint Planning, Daily Standup, Sprint Review, Sprint Retro. Story points estimate effort — not time. Jira tracks everything. Velocity and burndown charts measure progress.

These three topics form the foundation of your career as a professional developer. Keep your notes, revisit these concepts, and watch for all of them in the real world."

  - MDN Web Docs (Fullstack reference): developer.mozilla.org

**Visual:** Clean, simple slide — large question mark graphic or open speech bubbles

⏱️ Open

💬 "That's everything for today. You covered a LOT in one hour — the full software development lifecycle, how modern web applications are structured, and how Agile Scrum teams operate every single day.

I know this is dense, and it might feel overwhelming. That's completely normal. These are things that take months of working experience to fully internalize. But now you have the vocabulary and the mental models. When your first team uses these things, you'll recognize them.

I'll leave the resources on this slide — the Agile Manifesto, the official Scrum Guide, Atlassian's Agile tutorials, and MDN Web Docs for Fullstack reference. All of these are free.

What questions do you have? There are no bad questions — if you're unclear on anything, ask it now."

🎯 Take questions. Allow conversation. If time permits, draw the sprint cycle on a whiteboard from memory to reinforce it visually.
