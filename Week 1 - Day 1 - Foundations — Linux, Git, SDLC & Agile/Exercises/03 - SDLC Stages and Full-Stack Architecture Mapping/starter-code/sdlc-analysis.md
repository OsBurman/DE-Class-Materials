## Part 4: Real-World Scenario

**Scenario:**
A startup wants to build a food delivery app. They have an idea and some rough sketches on a whiteboard. A product manager, two developers, and a UX designer are on the team. They have 3 months to ship a working version.

Answer the three questions below:

### Question 1: Which SDLC phase should they start in right now, and why?
[YOUR ANSWER]

---

### Question 2: What should the team produce by the end of the first two weeks?
[YOUR ANSWER]

---

### Question 3: List the full-stack technologies you would recommend for building this app and assign each one to the layer it belongs to (Frontend, Backend, Database, or DevOps).
