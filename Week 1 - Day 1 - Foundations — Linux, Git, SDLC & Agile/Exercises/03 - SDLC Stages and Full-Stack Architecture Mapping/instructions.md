# Exercise 03: SDLC Stages and Full-Stack Architecture Mapping

## Objective
Demonstrate understanding of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) phases and how full-stack technologies map to each stage of building a real application.

## Background
The SDLC is the structured process every professional software team follows to plan, build, and maintain software. As a full-stack developer, you need to understand not just how to write code, but where your work fits within the bigger picture — from initial requirements gathering all the way through deployment and maintenance.

## Requirements

Complete the `sdlc-analysis.md` file in the starter code by filling in every section marked with `[YOUR ANSWER]`. Specifically:

1. **SDLC Phase Descriptions:** For each of the 6 SDLC phases listed, write 2–3 sentences that describe:
   - What happens during this phase
   - Who is typically involved
   - What the key output/deliverable is

   The six phases are: Planning, Requirements Analysis, Design, Implementation (Development), Testing & QA, Deployment & Maintenance.

2. **Full-Stack Technology Mapping:** For the "Design", "Implementation", and "Testing" phases, list at least 2 specific technologies or tools that are used in that phase and briefly explain what role they play.

   Example format (do not copy this — fill in your own):
   ```
   | Design       | Figma         | Used to create UI wireframes and mockups before coding begins |
   ```

3. **Full-Stack Layer Mapping:** Fill in the table showing which technology layer handles which concern in a full-stack application:
   - Frontend layer: What it handles, example technologies
   - Backend/API layer: What it handles, example technologies
   - Database layer: What it handles, example technologies
   - DevOps/Infrastructure layer: What it handles, example technologies

4. **Real-World Scenario:** Read the scenario at the bottom of the starter file and answer the three questions about which SDLC phase applies, what the team should do, and which full-stack technologies would be involved.

## Hints
- The SDLC phases build on each other — think about what information each phase needs from the previous one.
- "Full-stack" means the frontend (what users see), the backend (business logic and APIs), and the database (data storage) — plus the infrastructure to run it all.
- For the technology mapping, think about what tools you would actually use on a real project, not just what the names of the layers are.
- The scenario question is open-ended — there is no single right answer, but your answer should reference specific phases and technologies by name.

## Expected Output

A fully completed `sdlc-analysis.md` file with no `[YOUR ANSWER]` placeholders remaining. All tables should be filled in, all questions answered in complete sentences.

Example of a completed phase description (for reference — write your own for all 6):

```
### Phase 1: Planning
During the Planning phase, the project team and stakeholders define the scope,
feasibility, timeline, and resources needed for the project. Project managers,
business analysts, and technical leads are typically involved. The key deliverable
is a Project Charter or feasibility study document.
```
