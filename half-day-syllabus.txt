I am teaching a class on software engineering and each day will consist of two lectures, each one hour long. I have created folders for each day. Each day has topics separated into two parts. I want you to create two hour long lectures with slides that I can say to the class. I want to have both the slides and the verbatim script for it. 

Each week/day folder should have its own Slides Folder and in the Slides folder, there should be a folder called Part 1 with the slide descriptions and slides for part 1 and another folder called Part 2 with the slides descriptions and slides script for part 2. 

When you're done creating it, I want you to review what you've created and see if there's anything I'm missing that a person learning about these topics and this subject should know or anything excessive/extra in it. When you're doing that, there is a half-day-syllabus.txt file where you can see upcoming lessons and that way you won't add anything we are covering in previous or next lessons. If you think there is something we should add or take out in the slides you just created, don't change anything just mention it to me. 

Let's do the following week and day now with these topics:
